Auto sent text files

Auto way to send text files through fldigi and radio.

Make a network share folder "txtfiles" with samba, so everyone needs to send a txt or csv (plain text excel file) copy the file in that folder.
Run script in a pc with a ham radio audio interface and will sent all files through RF.

After file is send will removed.

I hope to help in case of emergency!
